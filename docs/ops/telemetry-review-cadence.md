# telemetry review cadence

## purpose

Create predictable post-launch review rhythm for reliability metrics.

## first week cadence

- daily review (release owner + reliability owner + support owner)
- required inputs:
  - crash-free sessions
  - ANR rate
  - alarm failure tickets
  - diagnostics trends by device/os
  - low health-score cohort trend

## ongoing cadence

- weekly reliability review
- monthly architecture+ops review for trend-driven improvements

## meeting output template

1. metric summary (good/neutral/bad)
2. incidents since last review
3. top 3 reliability risks
4. prioritized actions
5. owners and deadlines

## backlog prioritization rule

- reliability-impacting items outrank non-critical feature work.
